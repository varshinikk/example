The Government Botanical Garden, created in the 19th century, features ferns, orchids and a prehistoric, fossilized tree.The origin of the name is obscure. The first known written mention of the place is given as Wotokymund in a letter of March 1821 to the Madras Gazette from an unknown correspondent.[5] In early times it was called OttakalMandu. "Mund" is the Anglicised form of the Toda word for a village, Mandu.[6] The first part of the name is probably a corruption of the local name for the central region of the Nilgiri Plateau.[7
		The stem of the name (Ootaca) comes from the local language in which Otha-Cal literally means "single stone". This is perhaps a reference to a sacred stone revered by the local Toda people. The name probably changed under British rule from Udagamandalam to Ootacamund, and later was shortened to Ooty.[8]
		Ooty is in the Nilgiri hills, meaning the "blue mountains", so named due to the Kurunji flower which blooms every twelve years giving the slopes a bluish tinge Udagamandalam was originally a tribal land occupied by the Toda and Badagas along with other hill tribes who coexisted through specialisation and trade. The major tribes of Nilgiris area are the Toda, Kota, Irula and Kurumba.The Baduga langague is a dilect of Kannada.The Toda in the Nilgiris are first referenced in a record belonging to Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana and his general Punisa, dated 1117 CE.[9] The Toda people were known for raising water buffalo. The Badaga people known for farming activities.[10] Nilgiris was ruled by various dynasties like Satavahanas, Gangas, Kadambas, Rashtrakutas, Hoysalas, the Vijayanagara empire and the Rajas of Ummattur (on behalf of Wodeyars of Mysuru).[9][11][12][13][14] Tipu Sultan captured Nilgiris in the eighteenth century and extended the border by constructing a hideout cave-like structure.[10] The Nilgiris came into possession of British East India Company as part of the ceded lands, held by Tipu Sultan, by the treaty of Srirangapatnam in 1799. Ooty features a subtropical highland climate (Cwb) under Köppen climate classification.[19] Despite its location in the tropics, in contrast with most of South India, Ooty generally features mild conditions throughout the year. However, night time in the months of January and February is typically cold. Generally, the town appears to be eternally stuck in the spring season.[original research?] Temperatures are relatively consistent throughout the year; with average high temperatures ranging from about 17–20 °C (63–68 °F) and average low temperatures between approximately 5–12 °C (41–54 °F).
The highest temperature ever recorded in Ooty was 25 °C (77 °F), which by South Asian standards is uncharacteristically low for an all-time record high temperature. The rainy season in Ooty is generally cool and windy with high humidity. The wind chill may fall to as low as 5 °C (41 °F) during the day time. Wind is always high throughout the year. The lowest temperature was −2 °C (28 °F).[20] The city sees on average about 125 cm (49 in) of precipitation annually, with a marked drier season from December through March. covers an area of 65 acres.[34] The boat house established alongside the lake, which offers boating facilities to tourists, is a major tourist attraction in Ooty. It was constructed in 1824 by John Sullivan, the first collector of Ooty. The lake was formed by damming the mountain streams flowing down Ooty valley.[34] The lake is set among groves of Eucalyptus trees with a railway line running along one bank. During the summer season in May, boat races and boat pageantry are organised for two days at the lake.[35][36]

A boat house by the Pykara falls and dam is an added attraction to tourists.[37][39] Kamaraj Sagar Dam (also known as Sandynalla reservoir)[40] is located 10 km from the Ooty bus stand.[41][42] It is a picnic spot and a film shoot location on the slopes of the Wenlock Downs.[43] The various tourist activities at the dam include fishing and studying nature and the environment.[44] Parsons Valley Reservoir is the primary water source for the town and is mainly in a reserved forest and thus largely off-limits to visitors.
